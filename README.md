# SVG to iOS PDF

**Remember to run `npm run buildExporter` when you make changes, Supernova runs the built JS file, not the TS input**

Forked from [Supernova](https://github.com/Supernova-Studio/exporters/tree/main/exporters/svg-to-react).

The SVG to iOS PDF Drawable is an efficient package tailored to transform your SVG icons into Vector Drawable xml files.

Exporters are written in Typescript. You need to set a few things up. 

## Install the VS Code plugin

Main doc lives [here](https://developers.supernova.io/latest/building-exporters/setup-vs-code-extension-ktcqVU59)


## Code stuff

There isn't a lot of doc but you can get oriented [here](https://developers.supernova.io/latest/building-exporters/building-exporters-101/exporter-anatomy-HvQzZtsO).

Mostly trial and error will get you where you need to go. 

Don't forget to: 

- Install the dependencies with `npm install`
- Compile your TS with `npm run dev`
- Test with `cmd+shift+P Run Supernova Exporter`
